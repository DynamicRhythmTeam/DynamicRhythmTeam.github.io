      <p style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 200%">Have you ever listened to a song and wished you could play that particular song 
        in a rhythm game? Or maybe even wanted more of your own songs in a rhythm game without having to wait for a new DLC pack to be released?
        <br><br>
        Well, our dynamic rhythm game will create procedurally generated ‘rhythm game levels’ (also known as ‘maps’) 
        as songs are selected. We plan on achieving this by utilizing AI to detect various beats and inflections within the 
        music. The music will be sourced from the largest music library in the world, Spotify, giving us access to over 100 
        million songs and near-endless possibilities. </p>

        We are a group of Senior Computer Science students from Kennesaw State University collaborating together 
        to make what you read in the <span style="color:rgb(177, 55, 55);">Project Overview</span> above.
        This is our Senior Capstone Project for <em style="color:#88733b">CS 4850: Senior Project</em>.

        Some might ask: <strong style="font-family: Calligraffitti;"><em>Why A Rhythm Game?</em></strong>
        <br>
        Some of us like to play games in our spare time, and of course, the types of games we like to play are vast and varied.<br>
        However, something we all have in common is that we all love music. So, who doesn't want to play a game with music in it?
        Especially with songs from our own Spotify music library.
        With AI technology being introduced and advancing tasks by incorporating ChatGPT and the like, 
        we chose to connect such innovation to something that we would enjoy seeing with something we already enjoy.

        <strong style="font-family: Finger Paint;">A Few Facts About Our Game</strong><br>
        <li>This wasn't the only idea we had considered for our capstone project. There were about four other considerations.</li>
        <li>This game is made in the Unity game engine.</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
